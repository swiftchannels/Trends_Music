# DS_Project_1_Repo



This project explore music data over five decades in order to uncover hidden insights for our clients – concert promoters / event organizers.

The data analysis will reveal musical preferences of the general population – genre, artists, tracks, and lyrics.

The insights  will help guide our clients’ decisions in organizing the events by booking the right artist, and their respective genres and performing the right songs or tracks.

Questions: Who are the top artists? What are the top songs? What are the top genres? What words occur the most in the song title or lyrics? What are the general trends over time?

Goal(s): Our clients’ job / need is to maximize ticket sales and other revenues from their events. Insights from our project will help ensure their success.
